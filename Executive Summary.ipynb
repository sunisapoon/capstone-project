    "\n",
    "The automotive industry is rapidly embracing electric vehicles (EV) as the forefront of the future. With each passing year, EV markets are seeing exponential growth with a growing number of manufacturers substantially expanding their electric lineup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The growth in EV sector is driven by climate change and the reduction of carbon footprints generated from transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an emerging sector with growth potential of 22.6% per year between 2020-2027, Investing in this EV sector could yield substantial returns in the future. \n",

It offers a range of features that help users analyze and track financial markets, stocks, commodities, currencies, and other financial instruments.\n",

    "## Stocks to watch in electric vehicle manufacturer sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "![TESLA](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/600x300/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Tesla_Inc__TSLA_-removebg-preview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla is the biggest name in EVs. It has also become the largest car company in the world by market cap, traditional or electric—not to mention the eighth largest public company on the planet by capitalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The key for Tesla? The company makes a profit while most other stocks in this sector do not, netting earnings per share (EPS) of $3.62 in 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One caveat for investors is that Tesla is more than a car company. Its business touches many areas, including batteries, robotics and solar panels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NIO Inc. (NIO)**\n",
    "\n",
    "![NIO](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/600x300/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NIO_Inc.__NIO_-removebg-preview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Tesla, Nio is another one of the biggest names in the space—but the comparison to Tesla ends there. Nio is a Chinese startup, meaning investors are open to a whole new array of geopolitical risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NIO is also far smaller: Tesla delivered more than 400,000 vehicles in Q4 of 2022, ten times Nio’s quarterly deliveries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But when you compare valuations, you can see the value. Nio trades at a significantly lower price/sales ratio, and the discount has widened this year. Nio’s returns have been relatively subdued, while Tesla has nearly doubled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Li Auto Inc. (LI)**\n",
    "\n",
    "![LI](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/600x300/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Li_Auto_Inc.__LI_-removebg-preview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Li Auto is a Chinese EV maker whose shares fared surprisingly well in 2022, falling only 5percent when much of the rest of the market got crushed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The EV automaker also recently announced Q1 2022 deliveries of 52,584 units, representing an impressive 66percents year-over-year gain. For full-year 2022, Li delivered 133,246 units, up 47percents year over year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Li’s vehicles are all luxury SUVs that are targeted at high-end consumers. In the world of start-up EV automakers, revenue is a key focus. For Li Auto, its 2022 revenue gains stand out: Up nearly 68percents year over year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**XPeng Inc. (XPEV)**\n",
    "\n",
    "![XPENG](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/600x300/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/XPeng_Inc.__XPEV_-removebg-preview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Xpeng is another Chinese EV manufacturer. The company makes SUVs, sport sedans and family sedans. The company delivered 120,757 vehicles in 2022, up 23percents year over year. Revenue climbed 28percents over the previous year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "XPEV’s vehicles are targeted at “tech-savvy middle-class consumers,” according to the company. For investors banking on China’s economic growth continuing apace, this represents a tantalizing alternative for EVs market exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rivian Automotive (RIVN)**\n",
    "\n",
    "![RIVN](https://companiesmarketcap.com/img/company-logos/256/RIVN.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "an electric car manufacturer that has taken an innovative approach to vehicle design. Rivian has developed a ‘skateboard’ platform, a wheeled chassis powered by four electric motors – one at each wheel. This versatile chassis incorporates pre-installed fittings for various battery systems and can accommodate different body styles and functions. As a result, it’s a modular EV that offers maximum flexibility and can easily adapt to a range of vehicle types. Rivian’s platform is designed from the ground up to provide maximum flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lucid Group Inc. (LCID)**\n",
    "\n",
    "![LCID](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/600x300/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Lucid-Group-Inc..png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lucid is an American EV maker known for producing the fastest-charging car on the market, the Lucid Air.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lucid manufactures luxury EVs, but it delivered only 4,369 vehicles last year, blaming supply chain and production issues for its diminished performance. It’s also worth noting that Saudi Arabia’s public investment fund owns a 62percents stake in the company.\n",
